# PDF OCR Project

This repository contains code for performing Optical Character Recognition (OCR) on PDF files. The OCR process converts scanned documents or images containing text into editable and searchable data. This project focuses on processing PDF files specifically.

## Project Scope

The primary goals of this project include:

1. **PDF Processing:** Develop a PDF processing module that can extract text data from PDF files.

2. **OCR Implementation:** Implement OCR algorithms to recognize text within images embedded in PDFs.

3. **Text Extraction:** Extract the recognized text and provide it in a usable format (e.g., plain text, structured data).

4. **Language Support:** Ensure support for multiple languages in OCR recognition.

5. **Accuracy Improvement:** Work on improving OCR accuracy through preprocessing techniques and advanced algorithms.

6. **Documentation:** Provide clear documentation and examples on how to use the OCR code in this repository.

7. **Performance Optimization:** Optimize the code for speed and efficiency, especially when dealing with large PDF documents.

## Usage

To use the OCR code in this repository, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:**
git clone  https://github.com/parthk2510/OCR-code-for-pdf
cd pdf-ocr


2. **Install Dependencies:**
pip install -r requirements.txt


3. **Run OCR Processing:**
python ocr_processor.py input.pdf


Replace `input.pdf` with the path to the PDF file you want to process.

4. **Output:**
The processed text will be extracted and saved in an output file (e.g., `output.txt`).

## Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- Tesseract OCR Engine
- Other dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`
